          <h2 id="challenge">Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
          <p>
            During the development of these pages, several challenges were encountered and successfully addressed:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Floating "Go to Top" Button:</b> Initially, the button’s 
              placement and responsiveness were inconsistent. This was fixed 
              by using position: fixed and adding a hover animation (transform:
               translateY(-5px)) for a smoother user interaction.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Responsive Design:</b> Maintaining consistency across various screen sizes, especially for
               images and content sections, was a challenge.
             Media queries and a structured grid system were used to ensure
              elements adapted properly.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Navigation & Accessibility: </b>Ensuring seamless navigation with
               both a top navigation bar and a fixed side menu required careful positioning.
                The solution involved adjusting layout properties to prevent overlap and maintaining 
                proper spacing for readability.
            </li>
          </ul>
          
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 id="compliance">Compliance</h2>
          <p>

          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Semantic HTML: </b>Proper use of HTML5 elements (nav, header, section, footer)
               to enhance document structure and improve accessibility.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>WCAG Standards: </b> Ensuring accessibility by maintaining appropriate color contrast,
               providing descriptive
               alt text for images, and enabling keyboard navigation for interactive elements.
            </li>

            <li>
